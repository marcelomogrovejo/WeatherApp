# Description
<p>WeatherAppWidget project is a very simple widget app which is developed to learn how to implement a WidgetKit.<br>
The project consists of a widget that the user can add to the iPhone screen to see the weather condition on his/her location.</p>

# Getting started
1. Make sure you have the Xcode version 14.0 or above installed on your computer.<br>
2. Download the WeatherApp project files from the repository.<br>
3. Open the project files in Xcode.<br>
4. Run the active scheme.<br>

You should see the WeatherApp is installed.<br>

# Usage
In order to start you have to long tap on the screen to search and add the widget on your screen.<br>
ðŸš§ This app is under constuction ðŸš§

# Architecture
* WeatherAppWidget project is implemented using the <strong>Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)</strong> architecture pattern.

* Model has any necessary data structure needed to generate a weather.
* ViewModel is bridge between the Model and the View. It provides data and behavior to the View, allowing it to bind directly to the ViewModel properties and commands.
* View is responsible for displaying the user interface to the end user. It receives input from the user and presents the data provided by the ViewModel.

# Structure
<p>ðŸš§ In construction ðŸš§</p> 
* "Extension": Utils that can be used to fromatting data on the different Views among others.
* "ViewModel": View logic that handled user data and refresh user interface.
* "View": User interfaces like main view.
* "Model": Entities needed by the app like expenses.

# Running the tests
<p>ðŸš§ In construction ðŸš§</p>
<p>The CryptoDemo project can be tested using the built-in framework XCTest.<br>
To start testing the project, you will need to change to the 'CryptoDemoTests' target in your Xcode project, and then just run the tests project.</p>

# Deployment
<p>Keep in mind that deploying an iOS app to the App Store requires having an Apple Developer account.</p>
1. Click on the "Product" menu in Xcode and select "Archive." This will create an archive of your project.
2. Once the archive has been created, select it in the Organizer window and click on the "Validate" button to perform some preliminary tests on the app.
3. Once validation is complete, click on the "Distribute" button and select "Ad Hoc" or "App Store" distribution. 
This will create a signed IPA file that can be installed on iOS devices.
4. Follow the prompts in the distribution wizard to complete the distribution process.
5. Once the distribution is complete, you can use the IPA file to install the app on iOS devices

# Dependencies
[Swift Package Manager (SPM)](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) is used as a dependency manager.
List of dependencies: 
* [CryptoRepo package](https://github.com/marcelomogrovejo/cryptorepopackage) -> It contains the api calls needed to populate the user interfaces.
* [Kingfisher package](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/) -> It is a powerful, pure-Swift library for downloading and caching images from the web.
